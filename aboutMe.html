					The main reason on why I took this pathway is because I wanted to broaden my knowledge on coding languages. I have taken two previous classes that covered Java, JavaScript, and a bit of Python. I have also exposed myself to HTML prior to this class on my own for a passion project in 9th grade about making an app for budgeting. To reflect on the previous class in the pathway, Graphic Design has helped me refine on my capabilities in visual aspects of digital work. Hopefully, this class will help me understand the ins and outs of a website.

		    In my leisure time, I play video games a lot. I enjoy playing them by myself or with family/friends. I have my own PC and I play mostly Valorant and Roblox. A Roblox game that I've gotten into recently is Twenty One, hover over the image to learn more.&nbsp; On my phone, I play CoDM and Delta Force. On my Xbox, I play some of CoD, Halo, Battlefield, Ghost Recon, etc. I do prefer playing on my PC just because I've been playing on PC since I was 7. However, I've played a lot less of games because of school and college applications. </p>

				I also enjoy playing soccer, whether it's by myself or with other people. Soccer is a good source of exercise and it's really entertaining to play. Even if you don't feel like playing soccer, watching soccer isn't entirely bad either. There's great footage of crazy shots taken by professionals or amateurs. I play center back, near the goalie. I serve as the deterrent so people have a hard time taking the shot and most of the time, I succeed in blasting the ball to the other side of the field. A soccer player I like is Son Heung-min. He's a professional player who originated from South Korea who currently plays for the LA football club.

				Another one of my interests has to be technology. A short story about how technology has basically been embedded into my life is my dad. Some time after I was born, he went abroad to the US to support my family in the Philippines but also to get us to the US. Every morning, my mom would call my dad and we would say hi and see how he's doiing. Aside from that, I've always been fascinated by the mechanisms within machinery and the technology running behind the scenes. I got into aerodynamics before I knew what the term for it was. I understood the idea of air friction/drag, downforce, etc. Eventually, this fostered for a deep lust to understand physics.

				Building on my early curiosity for physics, my biggest goal (as of right now) is to attend a college and major in engineering. I have not decided on a specific type of engineering nor a school, but I am leaning towards mechanical or aerospace engineering. The two subsets of engineering are what I got into as a youngin. I think that having a job where I learn and handle the things I once dreamt of as a kid would make me a happy person. Aside from that, the paycheck is also enticing.

			<h2>
			
				My design choices
			
			</h2>
			
				<p>

					I created my about me page to have the following (not in any particular order): 
					<br> <b>1)</b> Info cards, supplement to picture/video that needs them, that expand towards the center of the page with additional information about the graphic. The bulk of the code was produced by ChatGPT, although I did refine bits and pieces to produce the effect that I wanted. 
					<br> <b>2)</b> An embedded video of Twenty One, the Roblox game that I mentioned that plays on the page without opening another tab to view the video.
					<br> <b>3)</b> On the soccer info card, there is a link to Song Heung-Min's Wikipedia page to learn more about him and his career.
					<br> <b>4)</b> Borders around the graphics on the page to create a structured, cut feel. To make sure that each picture fit in the same borders, I used photoshop to edit them all to have the same width and height. For the video, I used CSS to make the width and height the same as the pictures.
					<br> <b>5)</b> Graphics to go along with their corresponding paragraph of text that explains my interests.
