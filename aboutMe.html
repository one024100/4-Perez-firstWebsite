			I like video games, specifically those in the FPS genre. Currently, I play Valorant and Delta Force. Games I've played in the past include but are not limited to: Halo, CoD, and Battlefield. I also enjoy playing soccer, whether it's by myself or with other people. Food is another big thing, whether it's cooking or eating it. Another one of my interests has to be technology. From military vehicles to mechanical pencils, I find moving parts fascinating.

				My biggest current goal is to attend a college and major in engineering. I have not decided on a specific type of engineering nor a school, but I am leaning towards mechanical or aerospace engineering. The two branches of engineering embody my passion for problem solving and innovation, while offering great salaries. I mention the salaries because just like everyone else, I want to live with a salary that will not limit my wants.
